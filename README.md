# CodeCopyCat

CodeCopyCat is a tool to train you typing skills,
while learning to code or reading something interesting.

## How does it work?

- Find a file in a GitHub public repository that you want to practice you typing skills with.
- Alternatively you can create a new repository and add any file that you want to use.
- Copy the raw file url into CodeCopyCat and start typing :)

This is where you can get the raw file url:
